Physical constants (A, E_a, T, k_B) for Arrhenius rate calculations.
COLOR_MAP: Maps atom types to colors for visualization (e.g., 0: white = empty, 2: blue = mobile atoms).
EVENT_TYPES: Defines simulation events (diffusion, attachment, desorption) with rate functions and allowed atom types.
Key Lines:
A = 1e12: Attempt frequency for rate calculations.
COLOR_MAP: Used in visualization.py to color atoms.
EVENT_TYPES: Configures event rules for the KMC core.
