Purpose: Implements rate calculations and neighbor checks.
Functions:

arrhenius(): Computes rates using the Arrhenius equation.
atom_attachment_rate(): Checks if a site is empty and calculates attachment rate.
atom_diffusion_rate(): Computes diffusion rate based on vacant neighbors.
get_neighbors(): Returns periodic boundary neighbors (3D).
Key Lines:
k = A * np.exp(-E_a / (k_B * T)): Core rate calculation.
vacant = sum(lattice[n] == 0 for n in neighbors): Counts empty neighbor sites for diffusion.
