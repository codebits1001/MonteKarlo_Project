Purpose: 3D visualization of the lattice.
Function: visualize_lattice()
Key Features:

Uses COLOR_MAP from constants.py to color atoms.
Plots occupied sites as 3D scatter points.
Displays coverage % in the title.
Key Lines:
ax.scatter(x, y, z, c=colors): Renders atoms with type-specific colors.
ax.view_init(*viewpoint): Controls 3D camera angle.
